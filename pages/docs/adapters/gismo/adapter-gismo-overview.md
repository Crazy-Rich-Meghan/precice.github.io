## What is G+Smo?

G+Smo (pronounced gismo or gizmo) is a C++ library for isogeometric analysis (IGA). Geometry plus simulation modules aims at the seamless integration of Computer-aided Design (CAD) and Finite Element Analysis (FEA).


## How to get G+Smo?
The G+Smo adapter is a submodule of the G+Smo library, relies on the core functionality of the main library.  To get started, you need to install G+Smo on your system first.
